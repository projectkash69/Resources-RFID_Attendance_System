# RFID Attendance System
This is our last high school project and hopefully the best one.

## Description of the RFID Attendance
As the name suggests this attedance system is based on RFID technology along with enchanced features like encryptiion, anti RFID-exploitation and improved security.
We have used NodeMCU ESP8266 as micro controller and processor.The data is recieved from RFID tag through tag reader then gets uploaded to a google spreadsheet through NodeMCU. This makes the mundane job of attendance easier.
